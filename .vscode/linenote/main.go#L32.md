This handler: 

- Ensures the request method is GET.
- Extracts the chirpID from the request path.
- Validates that chirpID is a proper UUID.
- Calls GetChirpByID (the function generated by SQLC) to fetch the chirp.
- If no chirp is found, returns a 404 Not Found response.
- If a chirp is found, formats it into a CreateChirpResponse and returns it with a 200 OK.
