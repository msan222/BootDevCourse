1. CONSTRAINT fk_user
CONSTRAINT: Defines a named constraint on the table.
fk_user: The name of the constraint (you can choose any name, but this one indicates it's a foreign key for user_id).

2. FOREIGN KEY (user_id)
This defines user_id as a foreign key.
A foreign key establishes a relationship between this table (tokens) and another table (users).
The column user_id in tokens must match an existing id in the users table.

3. REFERENCES users(id)
Specifies that user_id references the id column in the users table.
This ensures that only valid user_id values (i.e., existing id values in users) can be inserted into tokens.

4. ON DELETE CASCADE
Effect: If a row in users is deleted, all related rows in tokens will also be automatically deleted.
Why? This prevents orphaned records in tokens where a user_id exists but the user no longer does.
